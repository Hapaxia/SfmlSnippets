# SFML Snippets

## Introduction
SFML Snippets is a collection of code snippets for use with SFML.

There will be likely no connection amongst snippets.

## License
Note that the license in the root of the repository is the default license for all snippets. If a snippet has its own license (in its own folder/directory and/or in the files) then it overrides the default license.

## Requirements
The snippets in this repository all require the use of SFML version 2. They should work with the latest version of SFML 2 as well as any other version of SFML 2.
> Note that some features in SFML 2 were deprecated over minor versions so you may find some modification depending on your version.
